# Mega Drive PSG Envelopes

Builds a ROM which probably makes a horrible noise. Mostly for experimenting with programming software-driven PSG envelopes for defining PSG instruments for the [Mega Drive MIDI Interface](https://github.com/rhargreaves/mega-drive-midi-interface).

## Build

Docker:

```sh
./docker-make
```

Linux (requires `cmake` & [gendev](https://github.com/kubilus1/gendev)):

```sh
make
```
